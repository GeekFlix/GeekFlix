## üí° Idea / Solution <a name = "idea"></a>

The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthis project is a fullstack web of movie streaming content.
For this project we have worked in the group organization through agile methodologies with tools such as Trello or GitFlow.

There are any views in the app, starting with a home view without log in or register, where you can observe some promotional videos and titles about our movies.

You can log in or register a new account through CRUD's POST method. Once access is obtained, you will be able to access all the content of the web, with a home view in which all the movies are presented with their most important information (GET method). From here you can you can find any movie through our search bar and rent it !
